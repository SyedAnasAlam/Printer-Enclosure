# Printer Enclosure
Make a 3D printer enclosure "smart", by implementing following features
* Fingerprint controlled lock, using a servo motor
* Control fan speed using PWM from a potentiometer
* Measure temperature inside enclosure using a thermistor
* LCD screen to show fan speed and temperature

This project uses an Arduino Nano (Atmega328p) using [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/)
